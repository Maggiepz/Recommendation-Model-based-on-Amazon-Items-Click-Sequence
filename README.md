## Utilized uniform sampling to collect 85% of click sequence data as the training set and the remaining 15% as the test set based on Amazon e-commerce platform data from the beauty and cellphones categories; compared two basic models, Session POP and ItemsKNN, and demonstrated ItemsKNN as superior out of the basic models (0.55, 0.62); employed BPRLoss and the cross-entropy error to test three deep learning models (GRU4Rec, SRGNN, NARM)  and found NARM was the best out of the deep learning models (0.67, 0.51)
